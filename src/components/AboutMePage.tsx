        Hi my name is Audie Caceres and I'm a 23 year old software engineer
        living in Miami, FL. Originally I was born in the United States, but I
        lived most of my childhood in Nicaragua. Ever since I was little I had a
        deep passion for creativity in general and I always found myself wanting
        to learn new things .
      </p>
      <p className="about-me-p">
        I specialize in front-end development using technologies such as
        TypeScript, HTML, CSS and React. I find inmense inspiration and have a
        deep appreciation for front-end development and all that it encompasses.
        The blend of creativity, problem-solving, and the ability to shape user
        experiences has truly motivated me to be a front-end developer .
      </p>

      <p className="about-me-p">
        I always challenge myself to be more creative and to improve my tech
        skills by learning new technologies everyday and optimizing a better
        user experience .
